### Lab Report 1 
---

- `cd`
  1. No arguments
       When entering `cd` into the terminal, nothing is printed and the working dicectory is not changed. This is the output recieved becasue the command is used to change the working directory, but no path was given. No error has occured because the terminal doesnt know which directory to change into. 
  2. With directory path as an argument
    When entering `cd lecture1/` into the terminal, nothing is printed but the working directory is changed to the location specified by the path. Because the user can check the working directory using another command, no output is needed. 
  3. With file path as an argument
     When entering `cd lecture1/Hello.java` into the terminal, the error message `Not a directory` is printed. This is expected becasue working dicrectories cannot be files. Directories contain files and subdirectories. 
- `ls`
  1. No arguments
     When entering `ls` into the terminal, a list of the contents of the working directory is printed out. Because ls is short for list, we can expect this output from the command. For example, when you run this command in the "messages" directory, "en-us.txt", "es.mx.txt", and "zh.cn.txt" will be printed. 
  2. With directory path as an argument
     When entering `ls lecture1/messages` from the home directory of the workspace, the contents of the messages directory are printed even though messages is not the current working directory. This shows that the contents of a directory can be listed even if it is not the working directory so long as a path is given to that location. 
  3. With file path as an argument
- `cat`
  1. No arguments
  2. With directory path as an argument
  3. With file path as an argument
  
```
this will be a block of code
